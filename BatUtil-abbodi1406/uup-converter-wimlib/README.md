# UUP -> ISO Converter ft. WimLib

* Automated windows command script to process Microsoft Windows 10 **Unified Update Platform** files, allowing to build/convert them into a usable state (ISO / WIM).

- You can get UUP files by performing upgrade from Windows 10 build to later build (starting 15063).

* You can also obtain UUP canonical source using one of these projects:  
[UUP dump website](https://uupdump.ml/)  
[UUP Generation Project](https://uup.rg-adguard.net/)

- Refer to ReadMe.html for detailed usage and info.
